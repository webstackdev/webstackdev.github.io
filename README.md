# Resume

I'm using my GitHub personal site to show my resume as the default page served. The resume format is a two-column layout, with asides for achievements, skills, programming languages, and social media icons with links. You're welcome to use this as a template for your own site (MIT license). It uses the Eleventy static site generator, Nunjucks templates for HTML, SASS, and Puppeteer to generate a PDF version of the resume.

## Development

```bash
yarn serve
```
